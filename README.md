# Prediction Workflow

The R code in this repository serves as a general template/framework for generating prediction algorithms with a stacked generalization. The code was created to work specifically with the Magee Obstetrics Maternal Infant (MOMI) Database. These data are not available. Code should be modified to accomodate data of interest.
